# Training Documents

In this repository are a series of Jupyter Notebooks and files that you can use to teach yourself the basics of Python3.X

When working with the Jupyter Notebooks, make sure to either:
1) Have all of the notebooks in the same directory as the files
2) Have a line at the top of each notebook defining the path where the separate files are located.
* All Notebooks are written with (1) in mind.
