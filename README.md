# circDNA
This repository holds a Python3 script and examples used to generate a circular fragment model of DNA.

## Question: What makes it a "circle"
A circular model of DNA is defined as being "covalently closed". DNA has two antiparallel chains: the 'coding' strand and the 'complementary' or 'anti-coding' strand. Both strands are read from the 5' to 3' direction, where the prime-notation refers to the carbon atoms on the deoxyribose sugars that are attached to phosphate groups along the chains.
